# Snow density always 250 and sometimes NaN - therefore we drop it 
# Ceiling height is a misleading feature. "The ceiling height is an important parameter in aviation and is defined as the height of the lowest cloud layer covering more than half of the sky or where clouds are present above 6000m." - it says two seperate things and we should split it in two

# We added cloud_cover_more_than_50% but it turned out it wasnt necessary as we have effective cloud cover.
